I was going through twitter one day after I had once again failed to read the 
interesting article. My mind started to wander after a few sentences, and I 
felt like shit knowing that I was doing this dumb thing, and waisting my time
reading dumbed down versions of the truth. For hours I am told. This seemed weird to me. Why is it that I can read all this gobldygook for untold amounts of time, but as soon as something interesting comes by I am as useless as a table with no legs. So the thought struck me, why dont I twitterfy articles. WHy dont I break down these articles, put them in boxes and try to read them one at a time, rather than chip away at this insermountable.. mountain.. of text. So I built this extention. Turns out, it works. Prepare to get smarter.
